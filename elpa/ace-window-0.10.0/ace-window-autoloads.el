Select a window.
Perform an action based on ARG described below.

See `aw-scope' which extends it to work with frames.

selected window and the current window, so that the selected
buffer moves to current window (and current buffer moves to
selected window).

Prefixed with two \\[universal-argument]'s, deletes the selected

Non-nil if Ace-Window-Display mode is enabled.

Minor mode for showing the ace window key in the mode line.

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Ace-Window-Display mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is
positive, enable the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable
the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `(default-value \\='ace-window-display-mode)'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.
